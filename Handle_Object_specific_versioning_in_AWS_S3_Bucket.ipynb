AWS S3 is a storage service where we can store any kind of data/file in the form of an object without worrying much about its management. S3 refers to any data/file as an Object and these objects must be stored in a specific Bucket. \n",
        "\n",
        "So before storing any object in a bucket you must create a bucket first if not present. Bucket is a container which stores a number of objects in it. \n",

        "As the title suggests, “Versioning in S3” means adding version to the objects of a bucket. AWS S3 gives privilege to add multiple versions of an object. The motive behind this is to  save all the previous versions of an object. It is like saving the older version as a backup. This is very helpful when the current version is not working properly or can recover if any accident occurs. \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "*When you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for each object added to the bucket. Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you enable versioning have a version ID of null. If you modify these (or any other) objects with other operations, such as CopyObject and PutObject, the new objects get a unique version ID. [2]*\n",

        "Also if we want to get versioning for a few of the files still we have to pay the complete price of a bucket versioning. During my working experience I encountered such a scenario. I have to store some of the files in an already existing S3 bucket with a versioning feature and this bucket didn’t have versioning enabled. But as a developer I have to figure out some solution to this. So move to the next section to get an alternative to this issue. \n",
